### Project Description
[‡¥ö‡µá‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡¥æ ‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥±‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö‡µç ‡¥ö‡µã‡¥±‡µç ‡¥é‡¥ü‡µÅ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡µÜ is a drag-and-drop chaos game where users must pick only the authentic Sadhya dishes from a buffet of distractions ‚Äî including fast food, desserts, and junk. Place a burger on the banana leaf? Expect to be roasted in Malayalam. ü´£üçî‚ùå]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People think Sadhya includes pizza, noodles, and shawarma. What‚Äôs next ‚Äî ketchup on banana leaf? This madness must end.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We made a simulator that throws everything at you ‚Äî vada, fries, avial, ice cream, pav bhaji ‚Äî and only the true Sadhya warriors can drag the right items onto the banana leaf. Get it wrong and prepare for voice-meme scoldings in your mother tongue. üíÄüé§]
